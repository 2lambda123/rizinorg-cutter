Features
=============
This part will give a quick idea about the interesting features in Cutter.

Decompiler
=============
A decompiler is a sophisticated transformation engine that will analyze executable files and attempt to create a high level representation of the machine code in the executable file. In other words it tries to reconstruct the source code from which the executable was compiled in the first place.

Here's an image that compares one of the decompiler Cutter supports with it's disassembler.
