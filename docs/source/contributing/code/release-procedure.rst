Release Procedure
=================

1. Update translations submodule
    1. Update the translations in cutter-translations from Crowdin. The latest archive can only be generated by users with appropriate privileges.
    2. Place the archive in folder and run the script, see cutter-translations for instructions
    3. Commit to cutter-translations
    4. Update submodule in cutter
2. If there is desire to keep working in the master, create branch for the release and do all the following work there.
3. Update version
    #. appveyor.yml
    #. docs/sourc/conf.py
    #. docs/source/index.rst
    #. Cutter.pro
    #. Cutter.appdata.xml
    #. To be safe search for the previous version number.
4. Create a tag v1.11.0-rc1
    #. ``git tag v1.11.0-rc1``
    #. ``git tag push origin v1.11.0-rc1``
5. Create a GitHub release, mark it as pre-release save draft, set the tag to v1.11.0-rc1
6. Wait for packages to build
7. On all operating systems do the `Basic testing procedure`_ to ensure nothing badly broken.
8. If any major problems are found fix them. If a release branch is used fix them in master and cherry pick into release branch. If the amount of changes is sufficiently large repeat from step 3. increasing rc number by one.
9. Update version to 1.11.0
10. Create tag
11. Create release
    * Fill the release notes, preparing release notes can be started earlier. Compare current master or release branch against previous release to find all the changes. Choose the most important ones. Don't duplicate the commit log. Release notes should be a summary for people who don't want to read whole commit log. Group related changes.
12. Announcement
13. Close milestone if there was one


Basic testing procedure
-----------------------

This isn't intended as exhaustive testing process, just some simple steps to make sure everything isn't badly broken.

* Open simple executable like /bin/ls or calc.exe
* Make sure upgraded layout isn't completely broken
* Disassembly shows something
* Bundled plugins work
   * Open decompiler and select ghidra, it shows some C code at least for some functions
   * Open r2dec in decompiler widget, make sure it shows code
* Test that sample python plugin works
* Try debugger
   * Insert breakpoint in main
   * Start debuging
   * Go to main using function widget, make sure relocation was done correctly and you see code instead of unmapped memory and breakpoint is where you placed
   * Click continue until you hit breakpoint in main
* Delete cutter settings file, and test that clean start works and layout isn't broken
