Contributing documentation to Cutter
=======================================

If you reached this place you were probably looking to help and improve Cutter's documentation - Fantastic, welcome aboard!

As many other young projects, Cutter has a problem - it lacks comprehensive documentation and written content. Thankfully, contributing to Cutter's documentation doesn’t require you to have a deep knowledge about the internals of the project. Writing, reviewing, and editing the documentation are great ways to learn about Cutter.

Don’t like the way something reads? Discover some information that wasn’t documented? Your pull request will be gleefully embraced.

.. note::
   The documentation of Cutter is written using `Sphinx and reStructuredText <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html>`_. The syntax is quite straight forward and very similar to Markdown. In the future, we hope to move completely to Markdown as it is more popular.
